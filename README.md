> A way to re-run Cypress commands until a predicate function returns true

## Install

```shell
npm i -D cypress-recurse
# or use Yarn
yarn add -D cypress-recurse
```

## Use

```js
import { recurse } from 'cypress-recurse'

it('gets 7', () => {
  recurse(
    () => cy.task('randomNumber'),
    (n) => n === 7,
  )
})
```

The predicate function should return a boolean OR use assertions to throw errors. If the predicate returns undefined, we assume it passes, see examples in [expect-spec.js](./cypress/integration/expect-spec.js).

```js
it('works for 4', () => {
  recurse(
    () => cy.wrap(4),
    (x) => {
      expect(x).to.equal(4)
    },
  ).should('equal', 4)
})
```

**Important:** the commands inside the first function cannot fail - otherwise the entire test fails. Thus make them as "passive" as possible, and let the predicate function decide if the entire function needs to be retried or not.

## Yields

The `recurse` function yields the subject of the command function.

```js
import { recurse } from 'cypress-recurse'

it('gets 7', () => {
  recurse(
    () => cy.wrap(7),
    (n) => n === 7,
  ).should('equal', 7)
})
```

## Options

```js
it('gets 7 after 50 iterations or 30 seconds', () => {
  recurse(
    () => cy.task('randomNumber'),
    (n) => n === 7,
    {
      log: true,
      limit: 50, // max number of iterations
      timeout: 30000, // time limit in ms
      delay: 300, // delay before next iteration, ms
    },
  )
})
```

You can see the default options

```js
import { RecurseDefaults } from 'cypress-recurse'
```

### log

The log option can be a boolean flag or your own function. For example to pretty-print each number we could:

```js
recurse(
  () => {...},
  (x) => x === 3,
  {
    log: (k) => cy.log(`k = **${k}**`),
  }
)
```

You can simply print a given string at the successful end of the recursion

```js
recurse(
  () => {...},
  (x) => x === 3,
  {
    log: 'got to 3!',
  }
)
```

See the [log-spec.js](./cypress/integration/log-spec.js)

### post

If you want to run a few more Cypress commands after the predicate function that are not part of the initial command, use the `post` option. For example, you can start intercepting the network requests after a few iterations:

```js
// from the application's window ping a non-existent URL
const url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.cypress.io/fake-endpoint'
const checkApi = () => cy.window().invoke('fetch', url)

recurse(checkApi, ({ ok }) => ok, {
  post: ({ limit, value }) => {
    // after a few attempts
    // stub the network call and respond
    if (limit === 1) {
      // start intercepting now
      console.log('start intercepting')
      return cy.intercept('GET', url, 'Hello!').as('hello')
    }
    // you can use the value prop to look at the fetch results
  },
})
```

The argument is a single object with `limit`, `value`, and `reduced` properties.

See the [post-spec.js](./cypress/integration/post-spec.js) and [find-on-page/spec.js](./cypress/integration/find-on-page/spec.js).

**Note:** if you specify both the delay and the `post` options, the delay runs first.

### custom error message

Use the `error` option if you want to add a custom error message when the recursion timed out or the iteration limit has reached the end.

```js
recurse(
  () => {...},
  (x) => x === 3,
  {
    error: 'x never got to 3!',
  }
)
```

### accumulator

Similar to reducing an array, the `reduce` function has an option to accumulate / reduce the values in the given object. The following options work together

- `reduceFrom` is the starting value, like `[]`
- `reduce(acc, item)` receives each value and the current accumulator value
- `reduceLastValue` is false by default, turn it on to call the the `reduce` function with the last value (for which the predicate function has returned true)

TODO: document the above options

If there is a reduced value, it will be passed as the second argument to the predicate function.

See the [reduce-spec.js](./cypress/integration/reduce-spec.js) for examples.

### yield

If you are accumulating a reduced value, you can yield it instead of the last value. You can even yield both the last and the reduced values.

- `yield: "value"` yields the value that passed the predicate function
- `yield: "reduced"` yields the accumulated value
- `yield: "both"` yields an object with `value` and `reduced` properties

See the [reduce-spec.js](./cypress/integration/reduce-spec.js) for examples.

## each

This plugin also includes the `each` function that iterates over the given subject items. It can optionally stop when the separate predicate function returns true.

```js
import { each } from 'cypress-recurse'
it('iterates until it finds the value 7', () => {
  cy.get('li').then(
    each(
      $li => ..., // do something with the item
      $li => $li.text() === '7' // stop if we see "7"
    )
  )
})
```

The `each` function yields the original or transformed items

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
cy.wrap(numbers)
  .then(
    each(
      (x) => {
        return 10 + x
      },
      // stop when the value is 13
      (x) => x === 13,
    ),
  )
  .should('deep.equal', [11, 12])
```

See the [each-spec.js](./cypress/integration/each/each-spec.js) file.

- clear and type text into the input field until it has the expected value, see [type-with-retries-spec.js](./cypress/integration/type-with-retries-spec.js), watch the video [Avoid Flake When Typing Into The Input Elements Using cypress-recurse](https://youtu.be/aYX7OVqp6AE) and read the blog post [Solve Flake In Cypress Typing Into An Input Element

## Debugging

Use options `log: true` and `debugLog: true` to print additional information to the Command Log

```js
recurse(getTo(2), (x) => x === 2, {
  timeout: 1000,
  limit: 3,
  delay: 100,
  log: true,
  debugLog: true,
}).should('equal', 2)
```
